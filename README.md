# C Optimizer Surprise

This repository contains sample source code which with some C compilers at some optimizations shows behavior that might be unexpected for less experienced programmers.

## Trying
To try with your default compiler, run `make`.
To try with a specific compiler, run `make CC=compiler`.
For example, use `make CC=gcc` to run with GCC, and `make CC=clang` to run with clang.
